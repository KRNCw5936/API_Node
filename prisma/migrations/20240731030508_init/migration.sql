/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `user` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to alter the column `id` on the `user` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Char(36)` to `Int`.
  - Added the required column `password` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
